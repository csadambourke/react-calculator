# React Calculator App

This project was a tutorial supplied by the youtube channel Web Dev Simplified. The purpose of completing this
tutorial was to understand other reactjs formatting and to continue developing my nvim, tmux and git abilities
from the terminal.

## How it works

This calculator app is built with only two additional components. These include the DigitButton and OperationButton.
It doesn't use arrow functions followed by exports but original functions exported immediately.
No APIs were used in this project.
Main functionality is from useReducer.

### How to run app
Clone the git repo by either using git clone or downloading and extracting the zip file.

Open the project by cding into the directory or opening the project in your favourite IDE.

In the console, type npm install followed by npm start.
